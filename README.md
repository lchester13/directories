# Directories
Project file for coding challenge

# Description
This is a script that implements commands to allow a user to create, move, delete and list directories. 

# Installation and Running
Clone repo from GitHub and run the following command in the terminal: python3 directories.py
In order to run, you must have Python already on your machine in order to run the script.

# Other Information
I used Python 3 and VSCode to write this code on a MacBook. No helper libraries were used, hence the omission of a requirements.txt file.
